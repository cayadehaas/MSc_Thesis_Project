# MSc Thesis Project Transparency Lab 
This repository contains the code base of the Master Thesis project for the Master Project AI at the Vrije Universiteit (VU), Amsterdam.


In this Master Thesis project, we propose a framework for the preparation of textual documents for Questionnaire Generation. 

| Model  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data & Score Model  | In these models, the texutal documents are assessed on a number of criteria |
| Topic Model  | The qualitative documents are clustered using the Topic Model to obtain document corpora  |

## Prerequisites 
1. An x86 machine running Windows 10 or a Unix-based OS
2. Python 3.7 or higher. Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended so that you don't mess up the system Python.
